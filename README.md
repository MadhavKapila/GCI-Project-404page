A repository to complete task given by an organisation on google code_in
Just a new repository for completing task given by an organisation on Google code_in This repository created by me is for completing a task given by an organisation on Google Code-in In this repository I comitted ahtml file created by me which contains an 404 error webpage.Then, I created a .htaccess file which will tranfer the search engine to 404 page if the search engine is unable to find/load the url. Thanks for reading!!! I was able to complete this repository by knowing about GitHub from GitHub guide and knowing the beginning of HTML and CSS language which is taught to mee by my brother.
