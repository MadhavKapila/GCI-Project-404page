# GCI-Project-404page
A repository to complete task given by an organisation on google code_in
Just a new repository for completing task given by an organisation on Google code_in This repository created by me is for completing a task given by an organisation on Google Code-in In this repository I committed a HTML 404 Page file created by me and then I added a htaccess file which will automatically call 404 page if the server is unable to find the specified URL. Thanks for reading!!! I was able to complete this repository by knowing about GitHub from GitHub guide and knowing the beginning of JAVA language which is taught to mee by my brother
